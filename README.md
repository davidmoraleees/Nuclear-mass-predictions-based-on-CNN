### Models

The `models.py` file contains the definitions of the convolutional neural network models used in this project:
- `CNN_I3`: Model class for CNN-I3.
- `CNN_I4`: Model class for CNN-I4.

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file contains configuration settings for the project, including model parameters, data paths, and other settings.

## Usage

### Installing requirements
In order to run the scripts of the repository, you should download the necessary packages by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Processing
To process the raw data files and generate cleaned datasets, run the `data_processing.py` script:
```sh
python data_processing.py
```

### Model training
To train the CNN models, run the respective scripts:
```sh
python CNN-I3.py
python CNN-I4.py
```

### Model evaluation
To evaluate the models on new nuclei data, run the `new_nuclei_testing.py` script:
```sh
python new_nuclei_testing.py
```

### Results
The results of the model training and evaluation are stored in the `CNN-I3 results` and `CNN-I4 results` results directories. These directories contain plots and metrics for their performance.
